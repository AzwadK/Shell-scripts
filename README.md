Write a shell script containing the following functions:
● sum_of_series(): The function will take as input one number. It will then
calculate the sum of the series consisting 1 to the given number. The sum is then
stored in a variable. Return the variable from the function.
● Example - input: 5, output: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
Your main shell script will take the number as input. You need to perform a validity check
to ensure the inputs are valid. This can be done in the following ways:
● If the input is non-positive, print a message that the input is invalid. Then ask the
user for a valid input. Repeat this until you get a valid length as input.
Your script will then make calls to the functions you defined before, and print out the
resultant factorial from as follows:
The sum is: xxxx
